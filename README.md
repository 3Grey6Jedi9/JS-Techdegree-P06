 My sixth JavaScript Project



**SCRIPT.JS**

I've made changes in this file so that I can manage properly the sidebar and the button that triggers that sidebar.




**STYLES.CSS** 

These are the changes I've made in this file:

a) I've changed the wrapper style so the page is display properly respeting the sidebar space and covering the whole page.
So that everything looks great.

b) I've added other minor changes that are explain in the styles.css files in order to enhance and adjust several less
relevant elements. 

c) I've created new styles for the layout toggle button 

d) I've created new styles for the content sidebar 

e) I've created new styles for the picture in the sidebar

f) I've created new styles for the images in the project thumbnails 

g) I've created new styles for the images in the project page




**CUSTOM.CSS** 

In this new file I've enhanced or modify the following elements/classes/ids:

a) body (element)

I've changed the color and the background-color

b) h1 (element)

I've modified the font-family and I've added text-shadow

c) box (class) 

I've added  box-shadow
