# JS-Techdegree-P06
 My sixth JavaScript Project



**SCRIPT.JS**

I've made changes in this file so that I can manage properly the sidebar and the button that triggers that sidebar.




**STYLES.CSS** 

These are the changes I've made in this file:

a) I've changed the wrapper style so the page is display properly respeting the sidebar space and covering the whole page.
So that everything looks great.

b) I've added other minor changes that are explain in the styles.css files in order to enhance and adjust several less
relevant elements. 

c) I've created new styles for the layout toggle button 

d) I've created new styles for the content sidebar 

e) I've created new styles for the picture in the sidebar

f) I've created new styles for the images in the project thumbnails 

g) I've created new styles for the images in the project page




**CUSTOM.CSS** 

In this new file I've enhanced or modify the following elements/classes/ids:

a) body (element)

I've changed the color and the background-color

b) h1 (element)

I've modified the font-family and I've added text-shadow

c) box (class) 

I've added  box-shadow 

d) button (class)

I've added transition 

e) I've added an animation 

This animation creates a smooth transition of opacity for elements taht will make them appear gradually from
invisible (opacity: 0) to fully visible (opacity: 1) over a specified duration. 

Getting into details: 

- @keyframes fadeIn: This line defines the name of the animation, which is "fadeln."
- 0% { opacity: 0; }: This is the starting point of the animation, at 0% progress. It sets the opacity of the element to 0, making it completely transparent.
- 100% { opacity: 1; }: This is the end point of the animation, at 100% progress. It sets the opacity of the element to 1, making if fully visible. 


Next, we have a separate CSS rule: 

.fade-in: This is a class selector in CSS

'animation: fadeIn 1s ease;': This line applies the "fadeln" animation to any element with the class "fade-in." The animation will take 
1 second to complete and will use the "ease" timing function, which means it will start slowly, speed up in the middle and
slow down again at the end.
